# Steps to create Pull request

* Start by creating a new branch in the project repository. 

* Once you've made your changes in the branch, you push your branch to the GitHub repository.

* Now, you can create a pull request. 

* This is like a formal request to your friend to review your changes. 

* In the pull request, you can describe the changes you've made, explain why you made them, and provide any additional information or context that helps the reviewer understand your work.

* Your Collegue (or any reviewer) can then look at the changes you've made and provide feedback on them. They can comment on specific lines of code, suggest improvements, or ask questions.

* As the author of the pull request, you can continue to make changes and updates to your branch based on the feedback you receive. GitHub will automatically update the pull request with your new changes, and the reviewer can see the updates and provide further feedback.
