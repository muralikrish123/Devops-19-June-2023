# git push

* Once after repo is created you can push the files from local to github repo using `push` command

* To push files to remote server we may need to first setup the remote in local server

  `git remote add origin <git-link>` (origin is an optional name here, you can create remote with any name)

* Once remote is set our local repo is linked with remote GitHub

* Then you can start pushing the code from local to remote

  `git push origin <branch-name>`

* Delete branch in local machine and in github

  `git push -d origin <branch name>`
